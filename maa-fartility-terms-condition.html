                              Washed sperm, in general, live for 6-12 hours, but, sometimes as long as 24 to 48 hours. It’s not advised to be kept for too long. Thus, the timing for IUI is so important that it is advisable to do insemination within 3 hours.

                              The sperm needs to be washed and thus IUI shouldn’t be done at home. Patients should not attempt to do IUI at home as getting semen or air into the uterus can cause physio-pathological complications.   </p>

                     The doctors here are next to GOD for us, we cannot express our feelings in words.
